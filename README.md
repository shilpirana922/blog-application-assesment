Use npm install or yarn install to set up the api and client

api module requires a mysql database to complete the setup

This project consists of a backend developed in Node.js and a frontend developed in React.js.

The backend is responsible for handling data and business logic, and exposes a set of APIs for the frontend to consume. It utilizes the popular Express.js framework for building RESTful APIs and interacting with databases. The database may be relational (such as MySQL).

The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the backend APIs. It utilizes React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The frontend may use various UI libraries and tools such as Material UI, React Bootstrap, or Styled Components to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

To run the application, you will need to install Node.js and related dependencies for both the backend and frontend. You can then start the backend server and the frontend application separately, and they will communicate with each other via the APIs.
